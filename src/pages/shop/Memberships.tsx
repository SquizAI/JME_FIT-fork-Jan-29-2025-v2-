I do macro/nutrition personalization and ongoing coaching/macro manipulation when it's time for an adjustment. I help you build what you like to eat so that you experience fat loss/muscle gain while living a non-restrictive life. Everything is customized according to your TDEE, height, weight and BF%, activity level- then you get a guidebook from me with tons of info and a guideline for weekly check ins and feedback as well as a grocery list and sample meals. You eat the foods you like as long as it fits in your macros, which means you can stay on track anywhere and all the time, but still creates a healthy balance as fat only accounts for about 25%. The goal (once desired body fat % is achieved) is to roll into a reverse diet and add calories (macros) back in slowly with very little weight gain. At this point, maintenance or recomp phases are the typical next step before entering another deficit.

The workout part includes me sending videos of each movement (in a library) for you to know form and the exact sets/reps and perceived exertion in which I want you working. You track your weights used and reps completed so you can see that history the following week. You get new splits every 4 weeks so you can practice progressive overload and allow your body to get stronger before just changing the workout for that muscle group. You can also send me videos of yourself doing anything you have a question about or want me to send feedback for at check in through the app. They can be 3, 4, or 5 day splits, weights, body weight, bands, whatever you have access to. This is all based on what you can realistically do with your schedule and I build that activity into your nutrition.`,
